Feature: Batch Assign Required Series
  In order to quickly mark assigned image series for quality control,
  As authorized user for assign required series,
  I can batch assign image series that are assigned to the visit to specific required series of that visit.

  Background:
    Given a study "FooStudy" with configuration
      """
      visit_types:
        baseline:
          required_series: {}
        followup:
          required_series:
            SPECT_1:
              tqc: []
            SPECT_2:
              tqc: []
      image_series_properties: []
      """
    And a center "FooCenter" for "FooStudy"
    And a patient "FooPatient" for "FooCenter"
    And a visit "10000" with:
      | patient     | FooPatient           |
      | visit_type  | followup             |
      | description | Visit Extraordinaire |
    And an image_series "TestSeries1" with:
      | patient | FooPatient |
      | visit   |      10000 |
    And an image_series "TestSeries2" with:
      | patient | FooPatient |
      | visit   |      10000 |
    And an image_series "TestSeries3" with:
      | patient | FooPatient |
      | visit   |      10000 |
    And a role "Image Manager" with permissions:
      | Study   | read                                   |
      | Center  | read, update                           |
      | Patient | read, update, create                   |
