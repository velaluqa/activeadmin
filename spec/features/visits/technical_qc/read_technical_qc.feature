Feature: Read Technical Quality Control Results
  In order to ensure technical quality of assigned image series,
  As authorized user for `read_tqc` for a visit,
  I want to read existing answers for a required series tQC results.

  Background: 
    Given a study "TestStudy" with configuration
      """
      visit_types:
        baseline: 
          description: A simple visit type

    And a center "TestCenter" for "TestStudy"
    And a patient "TestPatient" for "TestCenter"

    And visit "10000" required series "SPECT_1" has tQC with:
