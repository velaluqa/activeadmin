Feature: Keep Required Series When Reassigning Visit
  In order to keep existing required series assignments,
  As an authorized user to assign_visit to image series,
  I am asked whether to override or reset required series assignments when assigning a different visit.

    Given I sign in as a user with role "Image Manager"
    When I browse to edit image_series "TestSeries1"

    Then I see "#20000"
    When I browse to visit "20000"
    Then I see "SPECT_3 MISSING"
